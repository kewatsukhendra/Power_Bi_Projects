This Power BI project visualizes and analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data to provide actionable insights into pollution levels across major cities. It helps track environmental trends, understand the sources of air pollution, and assess public health impacts.

📊 Features & Insights
City-wise AQI Analysis: Dynamic dashboards displaying AQI scores across different cities or regions.

Pollutant Breakdown: Visual analysis of major pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3.

Trend Analysis: Time-series line graphs to monitor AQI fluctuations across months and seasons.

Categorical Risk Levels: Color-coded indicators based on AQI categories (Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe).

Health Advisory: Insights on health implications tied to AQI levels.

Interactive Filters: Slicers for selecting year, city, and specific pollutants.
